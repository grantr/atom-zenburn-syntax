## Zenburn Atom Theme

A Zenburn theme inspired by
[zenburn.vim](https://github.com/jnurmine/Zenburn/blob/master/colors/zenburn.vim).

### Installation

Since this theme isn't included with Atom, install it manually:

```
git clone https://github.com/atom/zenburn-syntax
cd zenburn-syntax
apm link
```

### Development

The `test.rb` file is provided to test with various Ruby elements. The
[vim-hilinks](https://github.com/kergoth/vim-hilinks) plugin is very
helpful to determine what syntax group a character belongs to in vim.
